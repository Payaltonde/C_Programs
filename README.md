# C_Programs

👋 Hello! I'm Payal, a 1st-year BSc Data Science and Big Data Analytics student at MIT-WPU.

This repository contains my basic C programs written as part of my college practicals and personal practice.  
It includes fundamental topics I’ve learned so far.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Basic Input and Output
- Data Types and Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Arrays (1D and basic operations)

🚧 *Functions and advanced concepts will be added soon as I learn them!*

## 🎯 Purpose
To practice and strengthen my programming logic and understanding of C fundamentals.
